# Granth Agarwal

Backend engineer who keeps accidentally building production systems for fun.  
Curriculum vitae claims I “architect scalable backends.” Reality is I just refuse to let servers bully me.

## What I Actually Do
Python everywhere. Django when life needs structure. FastAPI when it needs speed. Celery when it needs therapy.  
PostgreSQL enjoys my company a concerning amount.

I build:
- Identity verification systems that behave like they escaped from a research lab.
- Multi-tenant marketplaces that refuse to fall over.
- Meme analytics engines that rank internet entropy with scientific sincerity.
- Automation pipelines that save humans from tasks they were never meant to perform.

## Current Experiments
- TrustSystem: Face embeddings, persona embeddings, vector search, fraud detection. The whole sci-fi package.  
- StandardStitch: School-uniform commerce but engineered like a logistics startup’s fever dream.  
- MemeTrends: Leaderboards for memes because someone had to quantify cultural decay.  

## Tools I Don’t Fear
Django, DRF, FastAPI, Celery, Redis, PostGIS, pgvector, RabbitMQ, Supabase, Docker, Linux.  
If it schedules tasks, stores objects, or panics under load, I’ve probably tamed it.

## Mildly Impressive Stats
- 40+ production-grade REST APIs shipped without crying (much).  
- 230+ automated tests written out of spite.  
- A published patent that sounds futuristic enough to raise eyebrows at airports.

## What I’m Up To
Building scalable systems, deleting technical debt I wrote yesterday, and pretending to enjoy frontends until someone else does them.

If any of this looks accidental, that’s because it probably was.
